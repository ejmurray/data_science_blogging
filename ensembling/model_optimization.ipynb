    "When doing machine learning using Python's scikit-learn library, we can often get reasonable performance out the algorithms just by using the default settings for hyperparameters. However, it is a much better idea to do at least some level of tuning of an algorithm to your specific problem and dataset. In this post, we will the concepts behind hyperparamter optimization and cross-validation, and demonstrate the process of tuning and training three algorithms - a random forest, support vector machine and basic feedforward neural network. \n",

    "## Better modelling through hyperparameter optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, when setting out to train a machine learning algorithm on your dataset of interest, you must first specify a number of arguments or **hyperparameters**. A hyperparameter is just a variable than influences the performance of your model, but isn't directly tuned during model training. For example, when building a neural network, the number of layers in the network and the number of neurons per layer are both hyperparameters that must be specified before training commences. By contrast, the weights in biases in a neural network are **parameters** (not hyperparameters) because they *are* explicitly tuned during training. As another example, when using the k-nearest neighbours algorithm to do classification, the value of k (the number of nearest neighbours the model considers) is a hyperparameter that must be supplied in advance. But how can we know what values to set the hyperparameters to in order to get the best performance from our learning algorithms? \n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, scikit-learn generally provides reasonable hyperparameter default values, such that it is possible to quickly build an e.g. kNN classifier by simply typing `clfr = sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier()` and then fitting it to your data. [Behind the scenes](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier.html#sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier), we can see the hyperparameter values that the classifier has automatically assumed, such as setting the number of nearest neighbours hyperparameter (`n_neighbors=5`) to 5, giving all datapoints equal importance (`weights=uniform`), and so on. Often, the default hyperparameters values  will do a decent job, so it may be tempting to skip the topic of model tuning completely. However, it is basically always a good idea to do at least some level of hyperparameter optimization, due to the potential for substantial improvements in a learning algorithm's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "We optimize hyperparameters in exactly the way that you might expect - we try different values and see what works best. However, some care is needed when deciding how we will measure if certain values work well, and which strategy to use to systematically explore\n",

    "## The bias-variance trade-off, training sets, and test sets\n",
    "\n",
    "When we train machine learning algorithms on a dataset, what we are really interested in is how our model will perform on an independent data set. It is not enough to predict whether emails in our training set are spam - how well would the model fare when predicting if a completely new, previously unseen datapoint is spam or not? \n",
    "\n",
    "This is the idea behind splitting your dataset into a **training set** (on which models can be trained) and a **test set** (which is held out until the very end of your analysis, and provides an accurate measure of model performance). Essentially, we are only interested in building models that are **generalizable** - getting 100% accuracy on the training set is not impressive, and is simply an indicator of **overfitting**. Overfitting is the situation in which we have fitted our model too closely to the data, and have tuned to the noise instead of just to the signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, this concept of wanting to fit algorithms to the training data well, but not so tightly that the model doesn't generalize, is a pervasive problem in machine learning. A common (but perhaps not enormously helpful) term for this balancing act is **the bias-variance trade-off**.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Charles' figure on overfitting and all that good stuff]\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, we never try to optimize the model's perfomance on the training data because it is a misguided and fruitless endeavour. But wait, didn't we also say that the test set is not meant to be touched until we are completely done training our model? How are we meant to optimize our hyperparameters then? "

    "## k-fold cross validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter **k-fold cross-validation**, which is a handy technique for measuring a model's performance using *only* the training set. k-fold CV is a general method, and is not specific to hyperparameter optimization, but is very useful for that purpose. Say that we want to do e.g. 10-fold cross-validation. The process is as follows: we randomly partition the training set into 10 equal sections. Then, we train an algorithm on 9/10ths (i.e. 9 out of the 10 sections) of that training set. We then evaluate its performance on the remaining 1 section. This gives us some measure of the model's performance (e.g. accuracy). We then train the algorithm on a *different* 9/10ths of the training set, and evaluate on the other (different from before) remaining 1 section. We continue the process 10 times, get 10 different measures of model performance, and average these values to get an overall measure of performance. The process looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "[k-fold CV illustration]\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use k-fold cross validation to optimize hyperparameters. Say we are deciding whether to use 1,3 or 5 nearest-neighbours in our nearest-neighbours classifier. We can start by setting the `n_neighbours` hyperparameter in our classifier object to 1, running 10-fold CV, and getting a measurement of the model's performance. Repeating the process with the other hyperparameter values will lead to different measures of performance, and we choose the `n_neighbours` value that worked best."

It is common to try to optimize multiple hyperparameters simultaneously - grid search tries each combination in turn, hence the name. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that grid search with k-fold CV simply returns the best hyperparameter values out of the available options, and is therefore not guaranteed to return a global optimum.
