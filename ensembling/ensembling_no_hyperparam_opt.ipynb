    "**Model ensembling** is a class of techniques for aggregating together multiple different predictive algorithms into a sort of mega-algorithm, which can often increase the accuracy and reduce the overfitting of your model. Ensembling approaches often work surprisingly well. Many winners of competitive data science competitions use model ensembling in [one](http://www.netflixprize.com/assets/GrandPrize2009_BPC_BellKor.pdf) [form](https://www.kaggle.com/c/amazon-employee-access-challenge/forums/t/5283/winning-solution-code-and-methodology) [or](http://arxiv.org/pdf/0911.0460.pdf) another. In a previous tutorial, we discussed how optimizing hyperparameters allows you to get the best performance from individual machine learning algorithms. Here, we will take you through the steps of building your own ensemble for a classification problem, consisting of an individually optimized:\n",

    "These algorithms have quite different structures, which suggests they might capture different aspects of the dataset and could work well in an ensemble. We’ll be working on the famous `spam` dataset and trying to predict whether a certain email is spam or not, and using the standard Python machine learning stack (`scikit`/`numpy`/`pandas`)."

    "## The motivation behind ensembling\n",
    "The general idea behind ensembling is this: different classes of algorithms (or differently parameterized versions of the same type of algorithm) might be good at picking up on different signals in the dataset.  Combining them means that you can model the data better, leading to better predictions. Furthermore, different algorithms might be overfitting to the data in various ways, but by combining them, you can effectively average away some of this overfitting. Furthermore, if you're trying to improve your model to chase accuracy points, ensembling is a more computationally effective way to do this than trying to tune a single model by searching for more and more optimal hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also fundamental reasons for why ensembling together different algorithms often improves accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is best to ensemble together models which are less correlated, because then you can capture different aspects of the blog post (see an excellent explanation [here](http://mlwave.com/kaggle-ensembling-guide/)). \n",

    "## Examples of ensemble learning\n",
    "You have probably already encountered several uses of model ensembling. **Random forests** are a type of ensemble algorithm that aggregates together many individual classification tree **base learners**. They are a good systems for intuitively understanding what ensembling is. [Explanation here]. A random forest is already an ensemble. But, a random forest will be just one model in the ensemble we build here. 'Ensembling' is a broad term, and is a recurrent concept throughout machine learning. Correcting individual parts that may go wrong, so the overall thing is correct. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you’re interested in **deep learning**, one common technique for improving classification accuracy is training different networks and getting them to vote on classifications for test instances (look at **dropout** for a related but wacky take on ensembling subnetworks). Combinging different models is a recurring trend in machine learning, different incarnations. If you’re familiar with **bagging** or **boosting** algorithms, these are very explicit examples of ensembling. "

Each tree is trained on bootstrapped data, and each split is only allowed to use certain variables. So, an element of randomness is introduced, a variety of different trees are built, and the 'random forest' ensembles together these base learners.\n"

A great introduction to the theory behind SVMs can be read [here](https://www.quantstart.com/articles/Support-Vector-Machines-A-Guide-for-Beginners). Briefly, SVMs search for hyperplanes in the feature space which best divide the different classes in your dataset. Crucially, SVMs can find non-linear decision boundaries between classes using a process called kernelling, which projects the data into a higher-dimensional space. This sounds a bit abstract, but if you've ever fit a linear regression to power-transformed variables (e.g. maybe you used x^2, x^3 as features), you're already familiar with the concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "SVMs can use different types of kernels, like Gaussian or radial ones, to throw the data into a different space. The main hyperparameters we must tune for SVMs are gamma (a kernel parameter, controlling how far we 'throw' the data into the new feature space) and C (which controls the [bias-variance tradeoff](http://scott.fortmann-roe.com/docs/BiasVariance.html) of the model).

    "There are plenty of ways to do model ensembling. Simple majority voting. We can also do weighted majority voting, where models with higher accuracy get more of a vote. If your output is numerical, you could average. These relatively simple techniques do a great job, but there is more! Stacking (also called blending) is when the predictions from different algorithms are used as input into another algorithm (often good old linear and logistic regression) which then outputs your final predictions. For example, you might train a linear model on the predictions. Blending. \n",

    "What happens when your dataset isn’t as nice as this? What if there are many more instances of one class versus the other, or if you have a lot of missing values, or a mixture of categorical and numerical variables? Stay tuned for the next blog post where we write up guidance on tackling these types of sticky situations.\n",
