    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "When doing machine learning using Python's scikit-learn library, we can often get reasonable model performance by using out-of-the-box settings. However, the payoff can be huge if you invest at least some time into tuning models to your specific problem and dataset. [In the previous post](http://blog.cambridgecoding.com/2016/03/24/misleading-modelling-overfitting-cross-validation-and-the-bias-variance-trade-off/), we explored the concepts of overfitting, cross-validation, and the bias-variance tradeoff. These ideas turn out to be central to doing a good job at optimizing the **hyperparameters** (roughly, the settings) of algorithms. In this  post, we will explore the concepts behind hyperparameter optimization and demonstrate the process of tuning and training a random forest classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll be working with the famous (well, machine learning famous!) [wine dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine), which contains features of different quality wines, like the acidity and sugar content. Our goal is to tune and apply a random forest to these features in order to predict whether a given wine is nice or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "The steps we'll cover in this blog post can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Tutorial overview.](hyperparam_intro_rf_only.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next two posts, you will learn about different strategies for model optimization and how to tune a support vector machine and logistic regression classifier. You will also find out how to take several different tuned models and combine them to build an ensemble model, which is a type of aggregated meta-model that often has higher accuracy and lower overfitting than its constituents.\n",

    "We start off by collecting the dataset. It can be found both [online](http://www3.dsi.uminho.pt/pcortez/wine/) and in our GitHub repository, so we can also just fetch it via `wget` (note: make sure you first type `pip install wget` into your terminal since `wget` is not a preinstalled Python library). It will download a copy of the dataset to your current working directory. "

    "You are now going to try to predict high quality wine with a random forest classifier. Chapter 8 of the [Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/ISLR%20Sixth%20Printing.pdf) book provides a truly excellent introduction to the theory behind classification trees, bagged trees, and random forests. It's worth a read if you have time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Briefly, random forests build a collection of classification trees, which each try to classify data points by recursively splitting the data on the features (and feature values) that separate the classes best. Each tree is trained on [bootstrapped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_%28statistics%29) data, and each bifurcation point is only allowed to 'see' a subset of the available variables when deciding on the best split. So, an element of randomness is introduced when constructing each tree, which means that a variety of different trees are built. The random forest ensembles these base learners together, i.e. it combines these trees into an aggregated model. When making a new prediction, the individual trees each make their individual predictions, and the random forest surveys these opinions and accepts the majority position. This often leads to improved accuracy, generalizability, and stability in the predictions.\n",

    "## Better modelling through hyperparameter optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "We've glossed over what a hyperparameter actually is. Let's explore the topic now. Often, when setting out to train a machine learning algorithm on your dataset of interest, you must first specify a number of arguments or **hyperparameters** (HPs). An HP is just a variable than influences the performance of your model, but isn't directly tuned during model training. For example, when using the k-nearest neighbours algorithm to do classification (see [these](http://blog.cambridgecoding.com/2016/03/24/misleading-modelling-overfitting-cross-validation-and-the-bias-variance-trade-off/) [two](http://blog.cambridgecoding.com/2016/01/16/machine-learning-under-the-hood-writing-your-own-k-nearest-neighbour-algorithm/) previous posts), the value of `k` (the number of nearest neighbours the model considers) is a hyperparameter that must be supplied in advance. As another example, when building a neural network, the number of layers in the network and the number of neurons per layer are both hyperparameters that must be specified before training commences. By contrast, the weights and biases in a neural network are **parameters** (not hyperparameters) because they *are* explicitly tuned during training. \n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that scikit-learn generally provides reasonable hyperparameter default values, such that it is possible to quickly build an e.g. kNN classifier by simply typing `KNeighborsClassifier()` and then fitting it to your data. [Behind the scenes](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier.html#sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier), we can can get the documentation on what hyperparameter values that the classifier has automatically assumed, but you can also examine models directly using `get_params`:"

    "In this post, we started with the motivation for tuning machine learning algorithms (i.e. nicer, bigger numbers in your models' performance reports!). You evaluated different candidate models by simple trial and error, as well as by using k-fold cross validation. You then ran your tuned models on the test set in order to predict wine quality from a set of chemical characteristics. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, you were keeping an eye on the accuracy of models in order to optimize hyperparameters, but there are problems for which you might want to maximize something else, like the model's [specificity or the sensitivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity). For example, if you were doing medical diagnostics and trying to detect a deadly illness, it would be very bad to accidentally label a sick person as healthy (this would be called a \"false negative\" in the classification lingo). Maybe it's not so bad if you misclassify healthy people as sick people (\"false positive\"), since in the worst case you would just annoy people by having them retake the diagnostic test. Hence, you might want your diagnostic model to be weighted towards optimizing sensitivity. [Here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2636062/) is a good introduction to sensitivity and specificity which continues with the example of diagnostic tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if you were doing spam email detection, it would arguably be worse to misclassify real email as spam (false positive) than to let a few spam emails pass through your filter (false negative) and show up in people's mailboxes. In this case, you might aim to maximize specificity. Of course, you cannot be so focused on improving the specificity of your classifier that you completely tank your sensitivity. There is a natural trade-off between these quantities (see [this primer on ROC curves](http://www.uphs.upenn.edu/radiology/education/resources/documents/receiver-operator-characteristic-analysis-primer.pdf)), and part of our job as statistical modellers is to practice the dark art of deciding where to draw the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes there is no model tuning to be done. For example, a Naive Bayes (NB) classifier just operates by calculating conditional probabilities, and there is no real hyperparameter optimization stage. NB is actually a very interesting algorithm that is famous for classifying text documents (and the `spam` dataset in particular), so if you have time, check out a great overview and Python implementation [here]((https://bionicspirit.com/blog/2012/02/09/howto-build-naive-bayes-classifier.html)). It's a \"naive\" classifier because it rests on the assumption that the features in your dataset are independent, which is often not strictly true. In the spam dataset, you can image that the occurence of the strings \"win\", \"money\", and \"!!!\" is probably not independent. Despite this, NB often still does a decent job at classification tasks. \n",
