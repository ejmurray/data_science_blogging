    "## Introducing randomized search: comparison with grid search\n",
    "\n",
    "You have already built a random forest classifier and tuned it using **grid search** to predict wine quality ([here](http://online.cambridgecoding.com/notebooks/cca_admin/scanning-hyperspace-how-to-tune-machine-learning-models)). Grid search is quite commonly used, and is essentially just a method that exhaustively tries out all combinations of manually prespecified HP values and reports the best option (i.e. the one leading to the highest test accuracy). The benefit of this approach is that you thoroughly test out various combinations, but this is of course very computationally expensive. For grid search to be tractable, you often have to restrict the number of combinations, which can severely limit how well you explore hyperparameter space and lead to you overlooking regions where accuracy would be highest. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to search through hyperparameter space to find optima is via **randomized search**. In randomized search, you sample HP values a certain number of times from some distribution which you prespecify in advance. So unlike grid search, in which you specify particular numbers to combinatorially try out, you instead specify distributions that cover the HP space you want to explore. For example, you might specify a standard normal distribution over an HP if you think reasonable values are roughly centered around 0, or a uniform distribution over some range if you think values within that range are about as likely to be \"good\". In randomized search, you also specify a `n_iter` parameter, which acts as a **computational budget**, controlling how many different parameter settings are tried out in total. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can visually summarize the grid search (grey boxes) and randomized search (purple boxes) strategies like so: \n",
    "\n",
    "![Grid search and randomized search](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nslatysheva/data_science_blogging/master/expanding_ML_toolkit/expanding_toolkit.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, both approaches are constrained by the same computational budget - they can only try out 9 different HP settings (i.e. certain values for HP1 and HP2). Randomized search tries out HP values from two normal distributions (purple bell curves), repeating the process 9 times and thus getting 9 different values of both HP1 and HP2. Most combinations fall into the meaty portion of the normal distributions, but occasionally the tails are sampled from as well - this means you have at least some chance of trying out distant regions that could potentially strike gold (i.e. the hypothetically optimal HP space leading to high accuracy, bottom right). \n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile, grid search tries out 3 values each of HP1 and HP2. Of course, these values do not have to be as close to each other as we have drawn (and one could indeed hit the gold space with grid search), but the idea is that since you are constrained to trying out *all* combinations of prespecified HP values, this intrinsically limits how much of the HP space can be explored. Specifically, here randomized search has searched a space that is 16 times bigger (we drew a 3x3 box for the grid search and a 12x12 box for the larger grid). The `n_iter` argument controlling the number of HP combinations to try out gives you access to a tradeoff between computational resources invested and the HP space you can explore. \n",
    "\n",
    "Check out this [paper](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume13/bergstra12a/bergstra12a.pdf) outlining the efficiency of randomized search compared to grid search, especially in high-dimensional HP spaces. You can imagine that if you already have 12x12=144 possible combinations of 2 HPs, adding another HP increases the number of possibilities to search through to 12x12x12=1728. This becomes very demanding very quickly and randomized search is the only feasible practical approach. However intuitively, were computational resources and patience infinite, grid search would become the better choice."

    "Scikit makes using randomized search easy with [`RandomizedSearchCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.grid_search.RandomizedSearchCV.html#sklearn.grid_search.RandomizedSearchCV). You can feed distributions of HPs to the `RandomizedSearchCV` object in two (fairly similar) ways:\n",
    "1. You can either define distributions over HPs, without immediately sampling from them, and pass these distributions to `RandomizedSearchCV`, which will proceed to sample `n_iter` number of times *with replacement* from the distributions to generate candidate HP combinations. \n",
    "2. You can sample from distributions immediately and pass a list of possible HP values to `RandomizedSearchCV`, and it will sample from these possible values `n_iter` number of times *without replacement*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Both approaches lead to the same outcome and you will be using the second one here as it allows you to have a peak at the HP values that were sampled beforehand.

    "Let's train the second algorithm, a **support vector machine** ([`SVM`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html)) classifier, to do the same wine quality prediction task. A great introduction to the theory behind SVMs can be found in Chapter 9 of the [Introduction to Statistical Learning book](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/ISLR%20Sixth%20Printing.pdf) or [in this nice blog post](https://www.quantstart.com/articles/Support-Vector-Machines-A-Guide-for-Beginners). Briefly, SVMs search for **separating hyperplanes** in the feature space which best divide the different classes in your dataset. If you had 2 features, SVMs would search for the best dividing line; if you had 3 features, SVMs search for the best dividing 2d plane, etc. Crucially, SVMs can construct complex, **non-linear decision boundaries** between classes by making use of a process called **kernelling**, which projects the data into a higher-dimensional space and facilitates the identification of a good boundary.\n",

    "The final model you'll tune and apply to predict wine quality is a logistic regression classifier ([`LogisticRegression`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html)). This is a type of regression model which is used for predicting binary outcomes (like good wine/not good wine). Logistic regression fits a sigmoidal (S-shaped) curve through the data, but can be viewed as just a transformed version of linear regression - a straight line predicting the [log odds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logit) of data points being in one of the two classes. A nice explanation of logistic regression can be found [here](http://online.cambridgecoding.com/notebooks/eWReNYcAfB/implementing-logistic-regression-classifier-trained-by-gradient-descent-4).\n",
    "\n",
    "One topic you will often encounter in machine learning is **regularization**, which is a class of techniques to reduce overfitting. The idea behind regularization is that you do not *only* want to maximize a model's fit to your data, since this is susceptible to overfitting. Regularization techniques try to cut down on overfitting by penalizing models, for example if they use too many parameters, or if they assign coefficients or weights that are \"too big\". Regularization means that models have to learn from the data under a series of constraints, which often leads to robust representations of the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can adjust just how much regularization you want by adjusting **regularization hyperparameters**, and since this is something you might want to do often, scikit-learn comes with some pre-built models that can very efficiently fit data for a range of regularization hyperparameter values. This is the case for regularized linear regression models like [Lasso regression](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LassoCV.html#sklearn.linear_model.LassoCV) and [ridge regression](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.RidgeCV.html#sklearn.linear_model.RidgeCV), which use l1 and l2 penalties, respectively, to shrink the size of the regression coefficients. These scikit modules offer a shortcut to performing cross-validated selection of the regularization hyperparameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "But you can also optimize how much regularization you want yourself, while at the same time tuning other hyperparameters (like the choice between l1 and l2 penalty), in the same manner as you've been doing.\n",

Fancier techniques for hyperparameter optimization include methods based on [gradient descent](http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v37/maclaurin15.pdf), grad student descent (not recommended), and [Bayesian approaches](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.2944.pdf) which update prior beliefs about good values of hyperparameters based on observed performance (see [Spearmint](https://github.com/JasperSnoek/spearmint) and [hyperopt](http://hyperopt.github.io/hyperopt/)). The important thing is to try out different learning algorithms and HP settings on your dataset. \n",

    "1. Explain why the main advantages of randomized search over grid search are the following (as stated by [scikit](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/grid_search.html#randomized-parameter-optimization)):\n",
    "\n",
    "    * A budget can be chosen independent of the number of parameters and possible values.\n",
    "    * Adding parameters that do not influence the performance does not decrease efficiency.      \n",
    "    \n",
    "2. `RandomizedSearchCV` will throw an error if `n_iter` is greater than the number of possible HP combinations (e.g. `ValueError: The total space of parameters 25 is smaller than n_iter=100.`). Why is this a useful property? What happens if the number of combinations is indeed smaller than `n_iter`, but some of the combinations happen to be duplicates?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If the HP search space is quite small, the behaviour of randomized search can approach that of grid search. Specifically, if you were to sample values of two HPs from uniform distributions n times and set `n_iter` to $n^2$, then randomized search would be very similar to a grid search over the same HP ranges. But it wouldn't be quite identical - why?"
