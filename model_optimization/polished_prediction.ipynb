    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "When doing machine learning using Python's scikit-learn library, we can often get reasonable model performance by using out-of-the-box algorithms with default values for their hyperparameters. However, it is a much better idea to do at least some tuning of the algorithms to your specific problem and dataset. In this post, we will explore the concepts behind hyperparamter optimization, including overfitting, cross-validation and different strategies for traversing hyperparameter space. We also demonstrate the process of tuning and training three algorithms - a random forest, a support vector machine and a logistic regression classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll be working with the famous (well, machine learning famous!) [spam dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Spambase), which contains loads of NLP-mined features of spam and non-spam emails, like the frequencies of the words \"money\", \"free\" and \"viagra\". Our goal is to tune and apply different algorithms to these features in order to predict whether a given email is spam. \n",
    "\n",
    "The steps we'll cover in this blog post can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Tutorial overview.](hyperparam_intro_logistic.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next blog post, you will learn how to take different tuned machine learning algorithms and combine them to build an ensemble model, which is a type of aggregated, hybrid model that often has higher accuracy than its individual constituents.\n",

    "We start off by collecting the dataset. It can be found both [online](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Spambase) and (in a slightly nicer form) in our GitHub repository, so we just fetch it via `wget` (note: make sure you first type `pip install wget` into your Terminal since `wget` is not a preinstalled Python library). It will download a copy of the dataset to your current working directory."

    "## Better modelling through hyperparameter optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "We've glossed over what a hyperparameter actually is. Let's explore the topic now. Often, when setting out to train a machine learning algorithm on your dataset of interest, you must first specify a number of arguments or **hyperparameters** (HPs). A hyperparameter is just a variable than influences the performance of your model, but isn't directly tuned during model training. For example, when using the k-nearest neighbours algorithm to do classification, the value of k (the number of nearest neighbours the model considers) is a hyperparameter that must be supplied in advance. As another example, when building a neural network, the number of layers in the network and the number of neurons per layer are both hyperparameters that must be specified before training commences. By contrast, the weights and biases in a neural network are **parameters** (not hyperparameters) because they *are* explicitly tuned during training. But how can we know what values to set the hyperparameters to in order to get the best performance from our learning algorithms? \n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, scikit-learn generally provides reasonable hyperparameter default values, such that it is possible to quickly build an e.g. kNN classifier by simply typing `clfr = sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier()` and then fitting it to your data. [Behind the scenes](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier.html#sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier), we can see the hyperparameter values that the classifier has automatically assumed, such as setting the number of nearest neighbours hyperparameter to 5 (`n_neighbors=5`), giving all datapoints equal importance (`weights=uniform`), and so on. Often, the default hyperparameters values  will do a decent job (as we saw above), so it may be tempting to skip the topic of model tuning completely. However, it is basically always a good idea to do at least some level of hyperparameter optimization, due to the potential for substantial improvements in a learning algorithm's performance.\n",
    "\n",

This phenomenon of building models that do not generalise well, or that are fitting too closely to the training dataset, is called **overfitting**. This is a very important concept in machine learning and it is very much worth to get a better understanding of what it is. Let's briefly discuss the **bias-variance tradeoff**."

Essentially, we are only interested in building models that are **generalizable** - getting 100% accuracy on the training set is not impressive, and is simply an indicator of **overfitting**. Overfitting is the situation in which we have fitted our model too closely to the data, and have tuned to the noise instead of just to the signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, this concept of wanting to fit algorithms to the training data well, but not so tightly that the model doesn't generalize, is a pervasive problem in machine learning.

But, the straight line fit is not going to change very much across different datasets. The opposite trend applies to overfitted models.\n",

    "Enter **k-fold cross-validation**, which is a handy technique for measuring a model's performance using *only* the training set. k-fold CV is a general method, and is not specific to hyperparameter optimization, but is very useful for that purpose. Say that we want to do e.g. 10-fold cross-validation. The process is as follows: we randomly partition the training set into 10 equal sections. Then, we train an algorithm on 9/10ths (i.e. 9 out of the 10 sections) of that training set. We then evaluate its performance on the remaining 1 section. This gives us some measure of the model's performance (e.g. overall accuracy). We then train the algorithm on a *different* 9/10ths of the training set, and evaluate on the other (different from before) remaining 1 section. We continue the process 10 times, get 10 different measures of model performance, and average these values to get an overall measure of performance. Of course, we could have chosen some number other than 10. To keep on with the example, the process behind 10-fold CV looks like this:\n",

Repeating the process with the other HP values will lead to different levels of performance, and we can simply choose the `n_neighbours` value that worked best.\n",

    "\n",
    "The combination of grid search and k-fold cross validation is very popular for finding the models with the best possible performance and generalisability. So, in HP optimisation we are actually trying to do two things: (i) find the best possible combination of HPs that define a model and (ii) making sure that the pick generalises well to new data. In order to address the second concern, CV is often the method of choice. Scikit-learn makes this process very easy and slick, and even supports parallel distributing of the search (via the `n_jobs` argument).  \n",

    "## We tuned our random forest classifier! \n",
    "\n",
    "So, that was an overview of the concepts and practicalities involved when tuning a random forest classifer. We could also choose to tune [various other hyperpramaters](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html), like `max_depth` (the maximum depth of a tree, which controls how tall we grow our trees and influences overfitting) and the choice of the purity `criterion` (which are specific formulas for calculating how good or 'pure' the bifurcations we choose are, as judged by how well they separate the classes in our dataset). The two we chose to tune are regarded as the most important. Either grid search or randomized search is [probably fine](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/randomized_search.html) for tuning random forests.\n",

    "Fancier techniques for hyperparameter optimization include methods based on [gradient descent](http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v37/maclaurin15.pdf), grad student descent, and [Bayesian approaches](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.2944.pdf) which update prior beliefs about likely values of hyperparameters based on the data (see [Spearmint](https://github.com/JasperSnoek/spearmint) and [hyperopt](http://hyperopt.github.io/hyperopt/)).\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, we started with the motivation for tuning machine learning algorithms (i.e. nicer, bigger numbers in your models' performance reports!). We used different methods of searching over hyperparameter space, and evaluated candidate models at different points using k-fold cross validation. Tuned models were then run on the test set. Note that the concepts of training/test sets, cross-validation, and overfitting extend beyond the topic of tuning hyperparameters, though it is a nice application to demonstrate these ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, we tried to maximize the accuracy of our models, but there are problems for which you might want to maximize something else, like the model's specificity or the sensitivity. For example, if we were doing medical diagnostics and trying to detect a deadly illness, it would be very bad to accidentally label a sick person as healthy (this would be called a \"false negative\" in the lingo). Maybe it's not so bad if we misclassify healthy people as sick people (\"false positive\"), since in the worst case we would just annoy people by having them retake the diagnostic test. Hence, we might want our diagnostic model to be weighted towards optimizing sensitivity. [Here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2636062/) is a good introduction to sensitivity and specificity which continues with the example of diagnostic tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arguably, in spam detection, it is worse to misclassify real email as spam (false positive) than to let a few spam emails pass through your filter (false negative) and show up in people's mailboxes. In this case, we might aim to maximize specificity. Of course, we cannot be so focused on improving the specificity of our classifier that we completely bomb our sensitivity. There is a natural trade-off between these quantities (see [this primer on ROC curves](http://www.uphs.upenn.edu/radiology/education/resources/documents/receiver-operator-characteristic-analysis-primer.pdf)), and part of our job as statistical modellers is to practice the dark art of deciding where to draw the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes there is no tuning to be done. For example, a Naive Bayes (NB) classifier just operates by calculating conditional probabilities, and there is no real hyperparameter optimization stage. NB is actually a very interesting algorithm that is famous for classifying text documents (and the `spam` dataset in particular), so if you have time, check out a great overview and Python implementation [here]((https://bionicspirit.com/blog/2012/02/09/howto-build-naive-bayes-classifier.html)). It's a \"naive\" classifier because it rests on the assumption that the features in your dataset are independent, which is often not strictly true. In our spam dataset, you can image that the occurence of the strings \"win\", \"money\", and \"!!!\" is probably not independent. Despite this, NB often still does a decent job at classification tasks. \n",

    "In our next post, we will take these different tuned models and build them up into an ensemble model to increase our predictive performance even more. Stay... tuned! *Cue groans*."
