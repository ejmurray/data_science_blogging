    "## Introducing randomized search\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already built a random forest classifier, tuned using grid search, to predict spam emails ([here]()). Grid search exhaustively searches through some manually prespecified HP values and reports the best option and is quite commonly used. Another way to search through hyperparameter space to find optimums is by using **randomized search**. In randomized search, we sample HP values a certain number of times from some distribution which we prespecify in advance. There is [evidence](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume13/bergstra12a/bergstra12a.pdf) that randomized search is more efficient than grid search, because not all HPs are as important to tune and grid search effectively wastes time by exhaustively checking each option when it might not be necessary. By contrast, the random experiments utilized by randomized search explore the important dimensions of hyperparameter space with more coverage, while simultaneously not devoting too many trials to dimensions which are not as important. So, randomized search is very useful for high-dimensional feature spaces. \n",
    "\n",
    "To use randomized search to tune random forests, we first specify the distributions we want to sample from.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to sample from a uniform distribution and have the same number of n_iter trials, randomized search would be practically equivalent to grid search."

A great introduction to the theory behind SVMs can be read [here](https://www.quantstart.com/articles/Support-Vector-Machines-A-Guide-for-Beginners). Briefly, SVMs search for hyperplanes in the feature space which best divide the different classes in your dataset. Crucially, SVMs can find non-linear decision boundaries between classes using a process called kernelling, which projects the data into a higher-dimensional space. This sounds a bit abstract, but if you've ever fit a linear regression to power-transformed variables (e.g. maybe you used x^2, x^3 as features), you're already familiar with the concept. Do have a read of the guide we linked above.\n",

    "SVMs can use different types of kernels, like Gaussian or radial ones, to throw the data into a different space. Let's use the latter. The main hyperparameters we must tune for SVMs are gamma (a kernel parameter, controlling how far we 'throw' the data into the new feature space) and C (which controls the bias-variance tradeoff of the model).

This is a type of regression model which is used for predicting binary outcomes (like spam/non-spam). We fit a straight line through our transformed data, where the x axes remain the same but the dependent variable is the log odds of data points being one of the two classes. So essentialy, logistic regression is just a transformed version of linear regression.  Check out Charles' explanation and implementation of logistic regression [here].\n",

    "One topic you will often encounter in machine learning is **regularization**, which is a class of techniques to reduce overfitting. The idea is that we often don't just want to maximize model fit, but also penalize the model for e.g. using too many parameters, or assigning coefficients or weights that are too big. Read more about regularized regression [here](). We can adjust just how much regularization we want by adjusting regularization hyperparameters, and scikit-learn comes with some models that can very efficiently fit data for a range of  regulatization hyperparameter values. This is the case for regularized linear regression models like [Lasso regression](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LassoCV.html#sklearn.linear_model.LassoCV) and [ridge regression](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.RidgeCV.html#sklearn.linear_model.RidgeCV). These classes are shortcuts to doing cross-validated selection of models with different level of regularization.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, we started with the motivation for tuning machine learning algorithms (i.e. nicer, bigger numbers in your models' performance reports!). We used different methods of searching over hyperparameter space, and evaluated candidate models at different points using k-fold cross validation. Tuned models were then run on the test set. Note that the concepts of training/test sets, cross-validation, and overfitting extend beyond the topic of tuning hyperparameters, though it is a nice application to demonstrate these ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, we tried to maximize the accuracy of our models, but there are problems for which you might want to maximize something else, like the model's specificity or the sensitivity. For example, if we were doing medical diagnostics and trying to detect a deadly illness, it would be very bad to accidentally label a sick person as healthy (this would be called a \"false negative\" in the lingo). Maybe it's not so bad if we misclassify healthy people as sick people (\"false positive\"), since in the worst case we would just annoy people by having them retake the diagnostic test. Hence, we might want our diagnostic model to be weighted towards optimizing sensitivity. [Here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2636062/) is a good introduction to sensitivity and specificity which continues with the example of diagnostic tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arguably, in spam detection, it is worse to misclassify real email as spam (false positive) than to let a few spam emails pass through your filter (false negative) and show up in people's mailboxes. In this case, we might aim to maximize specificity. Of course, we cannot be so focused on improving the specificity of our classifier that we completely bomb our sensitivity. There is a natural trade-off between these quantities (see [this primer on ROC curves](http://www.uphs.upenn.edu/radiology/education/resources/documents/receiver-operator-characteristic-analysis-primer.pdf)), and part of our job as statistical modellers is to practice the dark art of deciding where to draw the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes there is no tuning to be done. For example, a Naive Bayes (NB) classifier just operates by calculating conditional probabilities, and there is no real hyperparameter optimization stage. NB is actually a very interesting algorithm that is famous for classifying text documents (and the `spam` dataset in particular), so if you have time, check out a great overview and Python implementation [here]((https://bionicspirit.com/blog/2012/02/09/howto-build-naive-bayes-classifier.html)). It's a \"naive\" classifier because it rests on the assumption that the features in your dataset are independent, which is often not strictly true. In our spam dataset, you can image that the occurence of the strings \"win\", \"money\", and \"!!!\" is probably not independent. Despite this, NB often still does a decent job at classification tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our next post, we will take these different tuned models and build them up into an ensemble model to increase our predictive performance even more. Stay... tuned! *Cue groans*."
