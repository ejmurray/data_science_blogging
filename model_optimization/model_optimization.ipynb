    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "When doing machine learning using Python's scikit-learn library, we can often get reasonable predictions by using out-of-the-box algorithms with default settings. However, it is a much better idea to do at least some tuning of the algorithms to your specific problem and dataset. In this post, we will explore how hyperparameter optimization can be used to tune models, different strategies for traversing hyperparameter space, and several related concepts such as overfitting and cross-validation. We also demonstrate the process of tuning, training, and testing three different algorithms - a random forest, a support vector machine and a logistic regression classifier.\n",

    "You'll be working with the famous (well, machine learning famous!) [spam dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Spambase), which contains loads of NLP-mined features of spam and non-spam emails, like the frequencies of the words \"money\", \"free\" and \"viagra\". Our goal is to tune and apply different algorithms to these features in order to predict whether a given email is spam. \n",
    "\n",
    "The steps we'll cover in this blog post can be summarized as follows:\n",

    "![Tutorial overview.](hyperparam_intro_logistic.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next blog post, you will learn how to take different tuned machine learning algorithms and combine them to build an ensemble model, which is a type of aggregated, meta-model that often has higher accuracy and less overfitting than its individual constituent models.\n",

    "## Loading and exploring the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "We start off by retrieving the dataset. It can be found both [online](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Spambase) and (in a slightly nicer form) in our GitHub repository, so we can just fetch it via `wget` (note: make sure you first install wget by typing `pip install wget` into your Terminal since it is not a preinstalled Python library). The command will download a copy of the dataset to your current working directory."

Chapter 8 of the [Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/ISLR%20Sixth%20Printing.pdf) book provides a truly excellent introduction to the theory behind random forests. Briefly, random forests build a collection of classification trees, where each tree tries to predict classes by recursively splitting the data on the features (and feature values) that split the classes 'best'. Each tree is trained on bootstrapped data, and each split is only allowed to use certain variables. So, an element of randomness is introduced when constructing a variety of different trees, and the random forest ensembles these base learners together.

    "## Better modelling through hyperparameter optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "We've glossed over what a hyperparameter actually is. Let's explore the topic now. Often, when setting out to train a machine learning algorithm on your dataset, you must first set a number of arguments or **hyperparameters** (HPs). A hyperparameter is just a variable that influences the performance of your model, but isn't directly tuned during the training phase. Most machine learning algorithms have hyperparameters. For example, when using the [k-nearest neighbours algorithm](http://blog.cambridgecoding.com/2016/01/16/machine-learning-under-the-hood-writing-your-own-k-nearest-neighbour-algorithm/) to do classification, the value of k (the number of nearest neighbours the model considers) is a hyperparameter that must be supplied in advance. As another example, when building a [neural network](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html), the number of layers in the network and the number of neurons per layer are both hyperparameters that must be specified before training commences. By contrast, the weights and biases in a neural network are **parameters** (not hyperparameters) because they *are* explicitly tuned during training. But how can we know what values to set the hyperparameters to in order to get the best performance from our learning algorithms? \n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, scikit-learn generally provides reasonable HP default values, such that it is possible to quickly build an e.g. kNN classifier by simply typing `kNN_clfr=sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier()` and then fitting it to your data. [Behind the scenes](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier.html#sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier), we can see the hyperparameter values that the classifier has automatically assigned, such as setting the number of nearest neighbours hyperparameter to 5 (`n_neighbors=5`), giving all datapoints equal importance (`weights=uniform`), and so on. Often, the default HP values will do a decent job (as we saw above), so it may be tempting to skip the topic of model tuning completely. However, it is basically always a good idea to do at least some level of hyperparameter optimization, due to the potential for substantial improvements in a learning algorithm's performance.\n",

This phenomenon of building models that do not generalise well, or that are fitting too closely to the current dataset, is called **overfitting**.

Overfitting is the situation in which we have fitted our model too closely to the data, and have tuned to the noise instead of just to the signal.\n",

    "In fact, this concept of wanting to fit algorithms to the training data well, but not so tightly that the model doesn't generalize, is a pervasive problem in machine learning.

But, the straight line fit is not going to change very much across different datasets (low variance). The opposite trend applies to overfitted models.\n",

    "Enter **k-fold cross-validation**, which is a handy technique for simulating having an abundance of test datasets available, and is used to measure a model's performance using *only* the training set. k-fold CV is a general method, and is not specific to hyperparameter optimization, but is very useful for that purpose. Say that we want to do e.g. 10-fold cross-validation. The process is as follows: we randomly partition the training set into 10 equal sections. Then, we train an algorithm on 9/10ths (i.e. 9 out of the 10 sections) of that training set. We then evaluate its performance on the remaining 1 section. This gives us some measure of the model's performance (e.g. overall accuracy). We then train the same algorithm on a *different* 9/10ths of the training set, and evaluate on the other (different from before) remaining 1 section. We continue the process 10 times, get 10 different measures of model performance, and average these values to get an overall measure. Of course, we could have chosen some number other than 10. To keep on with this example, the process behind 10-fold CV looks like this:\n",

Repeating the process with the other HP values will lead to different levels of performance, and we can simply choose the `n_neighbours` value that worked best.\n",

    "Traditionally and perhaps most intuitively, scanning for HPs is done using **grid search** (also called parameter sweep). This strategy exhaustively searches through some manually prespecified HP values and reports the best option. It is common to try to optimize multiple HPs simultaneously - grid search tries each combination in turn, hence the name. It works like this:\n",

So, in HP optimisation we are actually trying to do two things: (i) find the best possible combination of HPs that define a model and (ii) make sure that the model generalises well to new data. In order to address the second concern, CV is often the method of choice. Scikit-learn makes this process of HP optimization using k-fold CV very easy and slick, and even supports parallel distributing of the HP search (via the `n_jobs` argument).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that grid search with k-fold CV simply returns the best HP values out of the available options, and is therefore not guaranteed to return a global optimum. It makes sense to choose a somewhat different collection of possible values that is centred around an empirically sensible default."

    "## An alternative to grid search: randomized search\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid search is quite commonly used, but another way to search through hyperparameter space to find optima is by using **randomized search**. With randomized search, we don't build a grid of HP values we want to try out. Instead, we specify the regions of hyperparameter space we are interested in by specifying distributions that we want to sample from. Importantly, we also specify a computational budget (`n_iter`) which controls the number of HP combinations we will test out using CV. So, rather than the brute force approach of grid search, where we are forced to try out every combination, we can trade off between the computational resources we want to spend and the chances that we'll find the optimal combination of HP values. But because we prespecify regions where we think the correct HP values will lie, we are likely to cover some good possibilities even with a modest computational budget.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is [evidence](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume13/bergstra12a/bergstra12a.pdf) that randomized search is more efficient than grid search, because grid search effectively wastes time by exhaustively checking each option when it might not be necessary. By contrast, the random experiments utilized by randomized search can explore the important dimensions of hyperparameter space with more coverage. If we were to use uniform distributions for all of our HPs and allow as many sampling iterations as there are combinations of the HPs, then randomized search just becomes grid search. \n",

The two we chose to tune are generally regarded as the most important. Either grid search or randomized search is [probably fine](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/randomized_search.html) for tuning random forests.\n",

A great introduction to the theory behind SVMs can be read [here](https://www.quantstart.com/articles/Support-Vector-Machines-A-Guide-for-Beginners). Briefly, SVMs search for hyperplanes in the feature space which best divide the different classes in your dataset. Crucially, SVMs can find non-linear decision boundaries between classes using a process called kernelling, which projects the data into a higher-dimensional space. This sounds a bit abstract, but if you've ever fit a linear regression to power-transformed variables (e.g. maybe you used x^2, x^3 as features), you're already familiar with the concept. Do take a look at the guide we linked above.\n",

The main hyperparameters we must tune for SVMs are `gamma` (a kernel parameter, controlling how far we 'throw' the data into the new feature space) and `C` (which controls the bias-variance tradeoff of the model). Change the step size in the hyperparameter range specification to do better; we just chose a couple so that the code block runs quickly."

This is a type of regression model which is used for predicting binary outcomes (like spam/non-spam).

So essentialy, logistic regression is just a transformed version of linear regression. \n",

Read more about regularized regression [here](). We can adjust just how much regularization we want by adjusting regularization hyperparameters, and scikit-learn comes with some models that can very efficiently fit data for a range of  regulatization hyperparameter values. This is the case for regularized linear regression models like [Lasso regression](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LassoCV.html#sklearn.linear_model.LassoCV) and [ridge regression](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.RidgeCV.html#sklearn.linear_model.RidgeCV).

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, we started with the motivation for tuning machine learning algorithms (i.e. nicer, bigger numbers in your models' performance reports!). We used different methods of searching over hyperparameter space, and evaluated candidate models at different points using k-fold cross validation. Tuned models were then run on the test set. Note that the concepts of training/test sets, cross-validation, and overfitting extend beyond the topic of tuning hyperparameters, though it is a nice application to demonstrate these ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we tried to maximize the accuracy of our models, but there are problems for which you might want to maximize something else, like the model's specificity or the sensitivity. For example, if we were doing medical diagnostics and trying to detect a deadly illness, it would be very bad to accidentally label a sick person as healthy (this would be called a \"false negative\" in the lingo). Maybe it's not so bad if we misclassify healthy people as sick people (\"false positive\"), since in the worst case we would just annoy people by having them retake the diagnostic test. Hence, we might want our diagnostic model to be weighted towards optimizing sensitivity. [Here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2636062/) is a good introduction to sensitivity and specificity which continues with the example of diagnostic tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arguably, in spam detection, it is worse to misclassify real email as spam (false positive) than to let a few spam emails pass through your filter (false negative) and show up in people's mailboxes. In this case, we might aim to maximize specificity. Of course, we cannot be so focused on improving the specificity of our classifier that we completely bomb our sensitivity. There is a natural trade-off between these quantities (see [this primer on ROC curves](http://www.uphs.upenn.edu/radiology/education/resources/documents/receiver-operator-characteristic-analysis-primer.pdf)), and part of our job as statistical modellers is to practice the dark art of deciding where to draw the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes there is no tuning to be done. For example, a Naive Bayes (NB) classifier just operates by calculating conditional probabilities, and there is no real hyperparameter optimization stage. NB is actually a very interesting algorithm that is famous for classifying text documents (and the `spam` dataset in particular), so if you have time, check out a great overview and Python implementation [here]((https://bionicspirit.com/blog/2012/02/09/howto-build-naive-bayes-classifier.html)). It's a \"naive\" classifier because it rests on the assumption that the features in your dataset are independent, which is often not strictly true. In our spam dataset, you can image that the occurence of the strings \"win\", \"money\", and \"!!!\" is probably not independent. Despite this, NB often still does a decent job at classification tasks. \n",

    "In our next post, we will take these different tuned models and build them up into an ensemble model to increase our predictive performance even more. Stay... tuned! *Cue groans*."
